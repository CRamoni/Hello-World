# Hello-World
 
My Name is Collen Ramoni, i have studied BIS Information Science at University of Pretoria, im currently studying hons at Unisa. i have  learned information literature and its importance in our world. With that understanding, i have worked in a Freight Transport environment where data and information are not well tracked and utilised, and because i know the importance of recording valuable data and information, i felt the need to go further and try understand what is it that i can do with the data and information in providing better solutions in the industry (i am not limited to this industry though). Thats when i came across Data Science, i did a bootcamp with HyperionDev where i learned how to program using Python, process data, visualise it and present it, i have further learnt about Machine learning. With all that said, i am now planning to sharpen my skills, combine them and start initialising my own projects that will make a difference in any required industry. i am new to the technical industry and i am willing to learn from the experts and research as much as possible.
